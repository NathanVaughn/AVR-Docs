## Battery Storage

After using the battery, give it approximately 30 minutes to cool down.

Determine when the battery will be used going forward. If the battery will be used again
within 24 hours, proceed to fully charge the battery. The goal is to minimize the time
lithium batteries sit fully charged. Long periods of maintaining full charge will
dramatically reduce the lifespan of the battery pack, and can lead to swelling/premature
failure.

If the battery will not be used in the next 24-48 hours, please proceed with a storage
cycle, as demonstrated in the video below.

{{% alert title="Note" color="note" %}} Storage charging may take hours to perform
properly based on the starting voltage of the pack. A storage cycle should never be
conducted without direct supervision. In cases where the time for a proper storage cycle
cannot be committed, leave the battery in a discharged state rather than taking a chance
and leaving it unattended while on the storage cycle. {{% /alert %}}

The storage voltage range is typically between 3.70-3.85V per cell. However, lower
voltages, down to 3.4V per cell are unlikely to cause issues, especially over shorter
time periods. If the battery will be in storage for more than a week, itâ€™s best to
perform a proper storage cycle as time permits.
