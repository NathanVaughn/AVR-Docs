As discussed in the [Flight Test]({{< relref "../flight-test" >}})
video always be sure to power down your AVR drone and run a voltage
check on your battery. Always refer back to the
[battery documentation]({{< relref "../../battery-management/charging#charging-the-battery" >}})
if you have any questions regarding
charging, maintaining, and storing your battery.

**Congrats on
[building your AVR drone]({{< relref "../../basic-drone-assembly" >}}),
[configuring it]({{< relref "../../flight-controller-setup-and-calibration" >}}),
and performing your first flight test!**

We know it has been a challenging and hopefully rewarding journey,
and there will be a lot more exciting things planned as you work towards
the competition.
