**VS Code** is a popular open source code editor from Microsoft. It is just one of many IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) that can be used to write and test code. You will be using VS Code to build custom software for your drone.

VS Code can be downloaded and installed from the following Link: [VS Code Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Once VS Code is installed, take some time to familiarize yourself with the user interface. An intro to the layout and basic feature of VS Code can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface).

In the next step, we will get Python installed and test example scripts on your machine.
