In the [RC Transmitter Setup]({{< relref "../../rc-transmitter-setup" >}})
section we configured the stick and switch channels.
Now we will calibrate the endpoints of these channels so they can be saved to the FC.
QGC makes this very easy to do and the process can be observed in the following video.

Now that your transmitter has been calibrated using the Radio screen in QGC
we will move onto setting up our flight modes.
